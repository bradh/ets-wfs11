- Added tests and bug fixes written for NSG that apply to the base WCS specification:
1	The MIME returned for a DescribeFeatureType request where no specific output format is requested is "text/xml; subtype=gml/3.1.1"
2	When output format XMLSCHEMA is supported, the MIME returned for a DescribeFeatureType request where the output format requested is XMLSCHEMA is "text/xml; subtype=gml/2.1.2"
3	When output format "text/xml; subtype=gml/2.1.2" is supported, the MIME returned for a DescribeFeatureType request where the output format requested is "text/xml; subtype=gml/2.1.2" is "text/xml; subtype=gml/2.1.2"
4	The MIME returned for a DescribeFeatureType request where the output format requested is "text/xml; subtype=gml/3.1.1" is "text/xml; subtype=gml/3.1.1"
5	The MIME returned for a GetFeature request where no specific output format is requested is "text/xml; subtype=gml/3.1.1"
6	When output format GML2 is supported, the MIME returned for a GetFeature request where the output format requested is XMLSCHEMA is "text/xml; subtype=gml/2.1.2"
7	Whe output format "text/xml; subtype=gml/2.1.2" is supported, the MIME returned for a GetFeature request where the output format requested is "text/xml; subtype=gml/2.1.2" is "text/xml; subtype=gml/2.1.2"
8	N/A - NSG specific
9	The response for a DescribeFeatureType request with an invalid feature type is an exception.
10	N/A - NSG specific
11	A GetGmlObject request with traverseXlinkDepth = * is resolved correctly.
12	When a GetFeature request with XLink elements is not resolved in less time than the traverseXlinkExpiry, an exception is returned.
13	After a LockFeature request with an expiry attribute is submitted and the time expires, the lock is released
14	In response to a LockFeature request that includes some locked and some unlocked feature identifiers and lockAction=SOME, the response is a <WFS_LockFeatureResponse> element that lists the previously unlocked feature ids in the <FeaturesLocked> element and the previously locked feature ids in the <FeaturesNotLocked> element.  The previously unlocked features are locked.
15	The response to a LockFeature request includes the identifiers of features that were locked.
16	In response to a LockFeature request that contains a filter that doesn't match any features, the response is a <WFS_LockFeatureResponse> document that contains a value for the lockId attribute but contains neither a <FeaturesLocked> element nor a <FeatureNotLocked> element.
17	N/A - NSG specific
18	An invalid LockFeature request results in an exception
19	A transaction request with an invalid lock identifier returns an exception
20	In response to an Insert Transaction request with idgen=GenerateNew, the service generates unique identifiers for the newly inserted feature instances
21	In response to an Insert Transaction request with idgen=UseExisting where the identifiers are new values that do not belong to any existing features in the WFS, the service uses the existing gml:id identifiers for the newly inserted feature instances
22	In response to an Insert Transaction request with idgen=UseExisting where one of the identifiers used belongs to any existing features in the WFS, the service returns an exception
23	A valid HTTP Get request with an extra parameter not recognized by the WFS does not return an exception
25	Execute WFS transaction with XlinkPropertyName and test for exception.
24	N/A
26	Default resultType for GetFeature is results. Execute GetFeature with the resultType=results explicitly
